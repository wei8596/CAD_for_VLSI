Constraints file: test.pcf.
Loading device for application Rf_Device from file '6slx25.nph' in environment C:\Xilinx\14.7\ISE_DS\ISE\.
   "test" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc6slx25, package ftg256, speed -2

Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range: 0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to 1.260 Volts)

INFO:Par:282 - No user timing constraints were detected or you have set the option to ignore timing constraints ("par
   -x"). Place and Route will run in "Performance Evaluation Mode" to automatically improve the performance of all
   internal clocks in this design. Because there are not defined timing requirements, a timing score will not be
   reported in the PAR report in this mode. The PAR timing summary will list the performance achieved for each clock.
   Note: For the fastest runtime, set the effort level to "std".  For best performance, set the effort level to "high".

Device speed data version:  "PRODUCTION 1.23 2013-10-13".
